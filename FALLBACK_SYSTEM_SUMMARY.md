# Driver Fallback System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `supabase/migrations/create_driver_assignment_queue.sql`

- Created `driver_assignment_queue` table
- Stores 3 drivers per booking with positions (1, 2, 3)
- Tracks call status: pending → calling → accepted/rejected/no_answer
- Includes call_id for Bolna API tracking

### 2. Call Monitoring Service (Time-Based Fallback)
**File:** `src/services/callMonitoring.js`

**Key Functions:**
- `monitorDriverCall()` - Starts 60-second timer, auto-calls next driver if no response
- `markDriverAccepted()` - Manual accept, stops timer, assigns booking
- `markDriverRejected()` - Manual reject, immediate next driver call

**How it works:**
```javascript
Call Driver 1 → Start 60s timer
     ↓
  Response?
  /      \
YES       NO/Timeout
 ↓         ↓
Assign   Call Driver 2 → Repeat
```

### 3. Updated Driver Assignment
**File:** `src/services/driverAssignment.js`

**Changes:**
- `autoAssignDriver()` now creates queue of 3 drivers
- Starts call monitoring automatically
- Integrates with `callMonitoring.js` service

**Flow:**
1. Find 3 nearest drivers
2. Store in queue table
3. Call first driver
4. Start monitoring (60s timeout)
5. Wait for response or auto-fallback

### 4. UI Components
**File:** `src/components/DriverCallStatus.jsx`

**Features:**
- Shows active driver call in real-time
- Display: Driver name, phone, distance, position (1 of 3)
- Two buttons: "✓ Accept" and "✗ Reject"
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscription

**File:** `src/pages/Bookings.jsx`

**Integration:**
- Yellow status row appears under pending bookings
- Shows DriverCallStatus component
- Updates automatically when driver accepts/rejects
- Refreshes booking list on status change

## How It Works (User Perspective)

### Automatic Flow
1. Admin clicks "Auto-Assign All"
2. System finds 3 nearest drivers for each booking
3. Calls Driver #1 immediately
4. Waits 60 seconds for response
5. If no response → Automatically calls Driver #2
6. Repeats until driver accepts or all 3 reject

### Manual Testing Flow
1. Admin clicks "Auto-Assign All"
2. Yellow status row appears showing active call
3. Admin can click:
   - "✓ Accept" → Immediately assigns that driver
   - "✗ Reject" → Immediately calls next driver (no 60s wait)
4. Process continues until assignment or failure

## Key Features

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Queue system for 3 drivers
- [x] Automatic 60-second timeout fallback
- [x] Manual accept/reject buttons for testing
- [x] Real-time call status display

## How to Test Right Now

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Run SQL Migration**
   ```
   Open Supabase Dashboard
   → SQL Editor
   → Copy contents of: supabase/migrations/create_driver_assignment_queue.sql
   → Click "Run"
   ```

2. **Start Dev Server** (if not already running)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Bookings Dashboard**
   ```
   Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/dashboard/bookings
   ```

4. **Test Fallback**
   ```
   a. Click "Auto-Assign All" button
   b. Watch console logs (press F12)
   c. Yellow status row appears under booking
   d. Click "✗ Reject" to test fallback
   e. Next driver should be called immediately
   f. Click "✓ Accept" to assign
   ```

### What You'll See

**Console Output:**
```
🚗🚗🚗 [Driver Search] Finding nearest 3 drivers...
✅ [Driver Search] Found 3 available driver(s)
📋 [Driver Queue] Storing fallback driver queue...
📞 [Driver Queue] Calling first driver in queue...
⏰ [Call Monitor] Started monitoring call
```

**In Dashboard:**
- Yellow row appears below booking
- Shows: "Active Call - Rajesh Kumar (Position 1 of 3)"
- Two buttons: Accept / Reject

**When You Click Reject:**
```
❌ [Call Monitor] Driver rejected, calling next driver immediately
📞 [Call Monitor] Calling next driver: Amit Singh
⏰ [Call Monitor] Starting new monitor
```

## Technical Details

### Call Monitoring Logic

```javascript
// When driver assigned
autoAssignDriver(booking)
  → findNearestDrivers(3)           // Get 3 drivers
  → storeDriverQueue(drivers)        // Save to DB
  → callNextDriverInQueue()          // Call driver 1
  → monitorDriverCall(60 seconds)    // Start timer

// Timer callback (after 60s)
setTimeout(() => {
  if (!driverAccepted) {
    markAsNoAnswer()
    callNextDriverInQueue()          // Call driver 2
    monitorDriverCall(60 seconds)    // New timer
  }
}, 60000)

// Manual reject button
markDriverRejected()
  → clearTimeout()                   // Stop timer
  → updateQueueStatus('rejected')
  → callNextDriverInQueue()          // Call next immediately
  → monitorDriverCall(60 seconds)    // Start new timer
```

### Database Structure

**driver_assignment_queue table:**
```sql
| id   | booking_id | driver_id | position | status   | call_id  | called_at | responded_at |
|------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| uuid | booking-1  | driver-A  | 1        | rejected | exec_123 | 14:30:00  | 14:30:45     |
| uuid | booking-1  | driver-B  | 2        | calling  | exec_456 | 14:31:00  | NULL         |
| uuid | booking-1  | driver-C  | 3        | pending  | NULL     | NULL      | NULL         |
```

### Status Flow

```
pending → calling → accepted ✅
              ↓
           rejected → Next driver called
              ↓
          no_answer → Next driver called (after 60s)
              ↓
           failed → Next driver called
```

## Advantages of Current Implementation

- No backend deployment needed
- Pure frontend + database solution

### 2. Easy Testing
- Manual buttons for instant feedback
- No need to wait for actual phone calls
- Can test entire flow in 30 seconds

### 3. Reliable Fallback

### 4. Analytics Dashboard
- Driver acceptance rate statistics
- Average response time
- Peak hours for rejections
- Geographic patterns
