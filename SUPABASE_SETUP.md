## 🔧 Required Supabase Dashboard Setup

To complete the integration, you need to set up the following in your Supabase Dashboard:

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create drivers table
CREATE TABLE drivers (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  address TEXT,
  city TEXT,
  pin_code TEXT,
  vehicle_model TEXT,
  vehicle_number TEXT,
  service_type TEXT,
  profile_image_url TEXT,
  vehicle_image_url TEXT,
  vehicle_proof_url TEXT,
  driver_proof_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create bookings table (for future use)
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  driver_id UUID REFERENCES drivers(id),
  booking_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  timing TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  distance TEXT,
  amount TEXT,
  booking_source TEXT,
  remarks TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE drivers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE bookings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policies for drivers table
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read drivers"
  ON drivers FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert drivers"
  ON drivers FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update their own driver profile"
  ON drivers FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete drivers"
  ON drivers FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Create RLS policies for bookings table
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read bookings"
  ON bookings FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert bookings"
  ON bookings FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. Create a bucket named: `driver-files`
4. Make it **Public** (so uploaded files are accessible)
5. Set the following **bucket policies**:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload files"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'driver-files');

-- Allow public access to view files
CREATE POLICY "Allow public to view files"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING (bucket_id = 'driver-files');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete files
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete files"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'driver-files');
```

### Step 3: Create Admin User

Create an admin user in Supabase Auth for testing:

1. Go to **Authentication** > **Users**
2. Click **"Add user"**
3. Enter:
   - Email: `admin@gmail.com`
   - Password: `bhupendra` (or your preferred password)
4. Click **"Create user"**

- Use credentials: `admin@gmail.com` / `bhupendra`

### 3. Create Driver
- Go to Dashboard → Driver → Create Driver
- Fill in all required fields
- Upload profile image, vehicle image, vehicle proof, and driver proof
- Click Submit

### 4. View Drivers
- All drivers will be fetched from Supabase database
- Real-time updates
- View, Edit, Delete functionality

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Service Role Key**: The service role key should NEVER be exposed in frontend code. It's only used for server-side operations or migrations.

2. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Always enable RLS on your tables to protect data.

3. **File Upload Security**: The `driver-files` bucket is set to public for easy access. For production, consider implementing more restrictive policies.

4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` file to git. Add it to `.gitignore`.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Supabase Dashboard setup (tables, storage, policies)
2. ✅ Create admin user
3. ✅ Test login functionality
4. ✅ Test driver creation with file uploads
5. ⏳ Implement Hospital management (similar to Driver)
6. ⏳ Implement Booking management

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Login not working
- Check if admin user exists in Supabase Auth
- Verify Supabase URL and Anon Key in `.env`
- Check browser console for errors

### File upload failing
- Ensure `driver-files` bucket exists
- Check bucket is set to Public
- Verify storage policies are created

### Data not loading
- Check if tables exist in Supabase
- Verify RLS policies allow SELECT
- Check network tab for API errors
